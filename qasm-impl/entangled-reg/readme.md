# Entangles-Registers QASM

## Description

This QASM code demonstrates a simple quantum circuit entangling two 4-qubit registers (`a` and `b`). It applies Hadamard gates to all qubits in register `a`, entangles register `a` with register `b` using controlled-NOT (CX) gates, and measures each qubit in both registers.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure that you have a quantum simulator or quantum hardware platform that supports QASM 2.0 and the gates used in the code, including Hadamard gates (H), controlled-NOT (CX) gates, and measurement operations.
- Include the standard quantum library `qelib1.inc`, which provides definitions for common quantum gates.

## Usage

1. Load the QASM file into your quantum simulator or quantum hardware platform.
2. Run the simulation or execute the circuit on the quantum hardware.

## Circuit Details

- **Quantum Registers**: Two quantum registers `a` and `b`, each consisting of 4 qubits.
- **Hadamard Gate (H)**: Applied to each qubit in register `a`, creating superposition states.
- **Controlled-NOT Gate (CX)**: Entangles the qubits in register `a` with the corresponding qubits in register `b`.
- **Barrier**: Used to separate different parts of the circuit, ensuring no gate optimizations occur across it.
- **Measurements**: Each qubit in both registers is measured, and the results are stored in classical registers `c` and `d`.

## Example

Suppose all qubits in both registers are initialized to |0‚ü©. After applying this circuit:
- The qubits in register `a` will be in superposition states due to the Hadamard gates.
- The qubits in register `a` will be entangled with the corresponding qubits in register `b` due to the controlled-NOT gates.
- The measurement results in classical registers `c` and `d` will represent the collapsed states of the qubits after measurement.
