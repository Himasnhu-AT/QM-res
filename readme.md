# QM - research

This repository contains all of my study notes / practice / research done on Quantum Computing mainly through QISKIT library. ( IBM's qm library ). Planning to use Microsoft's Q# too sometime.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repo in no means is creation of qiskit or q#. It is to safe keep and track my learning journey in QM. It comes with open LICENSE, and can be reused for teaching / ( `community stuff` ) as per LICENSE

## Repo organizations: 

- `python-impl`: Contains all of the python implementaions. The code are divided in sub folder, with them their is a readme file, explaining the code.
- `qasm-impl`: Contains all of the qasm implementaion. Same subfolder structure.
- `notes`: This contains approx all of the notes made while learning QM.
- `*`: These will be git submodules containing my research / projects around QM

## my work:

##### research

Right now I'm researching on ability of Quantum Computer to break RSA, SHA-256, SHA-128 encryption algorithms and possible solution to this. As of now, im able to break RSA algorith mathematically, though few code optimizations are ongoing to improve its ability to break the algos.

## Qiskit-QM Codes 

#### (python) : 

- [ ] circuit draw : draw basic quantum circuit.
- [ ] communication_relation : generate circuit for communication analysis, so on...
- [ ] ghs state: implementation of ghz state
- [ ] init: example use of initialize gate to prepare arbitary pure states
- [ ] load_qasm: load qasm file on circuit
- [ ] qft: implementation of Quantum Fourier Transform
- [ ] reppleadd: repple adder based on `Cuccaro et al., quant-ph/0410184`
- [ ] st_swap: Example usage of StochasticSwap pass
- [ ] teleport: Quantum teleportation example
- [ ] qiskit_terra_level_0: Use Qiskit at introduction level

#### (qasm): 

- [ ] simple_qasm_code
- [ ] entangled_registers.qasm: 8 bit qubit entangling two 4 bit registers
- [ ] plaquette_check.qasm: plaquette check
