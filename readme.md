# QM - research

This repository contains all of my study notes / practice/research done on Quantum Computing mainly through the QISKIT library. ( IBM's qm library ). Planning to use Microsoft's Q# too sometime.

> This repo by no means is the creation of qiskit or q#. It is to safely keep and track my learning journey in QM. It comes with open LICENSE and can be reused for teaching / ( `community stuff` ) as per LICENSE

## Repo organizations:

- `python-impl`: Contains all of the python implementations. The code is divided into subfolders, and with them, there is a readme file, explaining the code.
- `qasm-impl`: Contains all of the qasm implementation. Same subfolder structure.
- `notes`: This contains approx all of the notes made while learning QM.
- `*`: These will be git submodules containing my research/projects around QM

## my work:

##### research

Right now I'm researching the ability of Quantum Computer to break RSA, SHA-256, and SHA-128 encryption algorithms and possible solutions to this. As of now, I'm able to break RSA algorithms mathematically, though a few code optimizations are ongoing to improve their ability to break the algorithms.

## Qiskit-QM Codes

#### (python) :

- [ ] circuit draw: draw basic quantum circuit.
- [ ] commutation_relation: generate circuit for communication analysis, and so on...
- [ ] ghz state: implementation of ghz state
- [ ] init: example use of initialize gate to prepare arbitrary pure states
- [ ] load_qasm: load qasm file on the circuit
- [ ] qft: implementation of Quantum Fourier Transform
- [ ] reppleadd: repple adder based on `Cuccaro et al., quant-ph/0410184`
- [ ] st_swap: Example usage of StochasticSwap pass
- [ ] teleport: Quantum teleportation example
- [ ] qiskit_terra_level_0: Use Qiskit at the introduction level

#### (qasm):

- [x] simple_qasm_code
- [x] entangled_registers.qasm: 8-bit qubit entangling two 4-bit registers
- [x] plaquette_check.qasm: plaquette check
